Implementing some common data structures and algorithms in python for fun using TDD

## Data Structures
- [x] Linked List
- [x] Doubly Linked List
- [x] Stack
- [x] Queue
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (in work)

## Algorithms
- Coming soon...

### Development

- Formatting: Black
- Linting: Ruff, Mypy
- Testing: Pytest
